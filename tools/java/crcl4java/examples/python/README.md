There are two indepenant ways of using crcl4java with python.

    * JPype -- uses the regular python interpeter and loads java classes within python
    * Jython -- runs the python interpreter within the jvm

For ubuntu use either:

sudo apt-get install python-jpype

or

sudo apt-get install jython

See comments at the start of each python file for instructions on how to run
and set paths.
