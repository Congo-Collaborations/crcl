This directory includes examples for javascript stand-alone 
interpreters/virtual machines. For an example connecting to javascript in 
web browsers see the crcl4java-vaadin-webapp.

The three interpreters tested were:

    * nodejs -- JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
    * jjs -- command to execute Nashorn interpreter that comes with Java 8
    * rhino -- stand-alone interpreter developed by mozilla.
